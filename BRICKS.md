## üóìÔ∏è List for Today (Jul 9) 2025 [Doesn't have to all be done today]

New Authentication System (Csrf + Cookies + Tokens) works and is tested!
Permissions is currently hard coded (user.role == Role.enum)

- We want roles to live in the database and for user.roles to be a many to many relation (1-way)
- User can have many roles
- 2 special roles (administrator : all permissions > bypasses all checks | user : no permissions )
- ask self (and chatGPT): Do we even need a role with no permissions and set it as default? Can we not assume no roles is the same state?
- custom roles can be given permissions (eg view_game, edit_game)

## üß± Completed Items üß±

- ‚úÖ Fix Token verification (Layout instead of app) + Loading states
- ‚úÖ Pagination swap to drop down + button combo from full button
- ‚úÖ Navigation Dropdown not getting config (we moved it and never reconnected it)
- ‚úÖ UserActions / Actions / Navigation dropdown fixes ( UserAction should use both Actions and Navigation structure )
- ‚úÖ Check for cookie before doing an appstore init
- ‚úÖ Add Create buttons to Dropdown Actions menu with future options (eg export)

**code cleanup**

- Platforms + Dashboard need localized strings
- Fix Reset Password Flow (haven't touched this through many updates of token system)
- Fix Throttle (JWT Guards run after Throttle Guard therefor userId is never set, this is a minor issue but causes conflicts when multiple users on the same ip are using the app)

- Logs should also have folder structure ... yyyy > mm > dd > yyyymmdd.log & yyyymmdd-1.log
- Remove logging on all successfull http requests (bloats logs) lets create a metrics sytstem that tracks http metrics
- Push old logs to cold storage (S3) & Clean Server of any Junk from Errors (Uploads Folder, unparanted images, etc.)
- go through and make sure all items are exported at the bottom of files and all functions are typesafed (composables)
