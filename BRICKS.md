# 🧱 BRICKS.md

**🧱 We build strong — one brick at a time. Let’s keep stacking. 🚀**

This document tracks our big ideas, improvements, next steps, and vision.
Each brick is an actionable piece of the wall we’re building together.

## ✅ Foundation Bricks — Done 🧱

- ✔️ Never trust client input — validate all DTOs server-side
- ✔️ Global HttpExceptionFilter for REST errors
- ✔️ Dead letter queue (DLQ) for logs that fail after all retries
- ✔️ Log rotation by date or max file size
- ✔️ All backend DTOs documented with API descriptions/examples
- ✔️ Env variable validation (DB_URL, REDIS_URL, etc.)
- ✔️ NODE_ENV=production enforced in prod
- ✔️ synchronize: true disabled in TypeORM prod
- ✔️ Job retries with exponential backoff
- ✔️ Bull Board at /admin/queues for visibility
- ✔️ QueueEvents listener for failed jobs
- ✔️ Graceful shutdown (onApplicationShutdown) drains workers safely
- ✔️ Health checks for BullMQ, Redis, and TypeORM
- ✔️ Router module refactored to router.ts
- ✔️ Logging to S3
- ✔️ Fallback for unexpected non-HTTP errors
- ✔️ Monitor BullMQ for stuck/blocked jobs
- ✔️ DB connection pooling tuned (maxQueryExecutionTime)
- ✔️ Workers drain before exit, logs flushed
- ✔️ AsyncLocalStorage or cls-hooked for request scoping
- ✔️ Move profile → user_profile for clarity
- ✔️ Per-route rate limits for sensitive endpoints (/auth/login, /reset)

---

## 🚧 Bricks In Progress 🧱

- Add request ID tracing end-to-end
- Push rotated logs to cold storage (S3)
- Add BullMQ metrics or Prometheus integration
- Send Slack/Email/Discord alerts for critical events (failed jobs, DB loss, crash)
- Add concurrency limits for workers to protect CPU
- Expand log monitoring to detect spikes/anomalies

---

## 🗓️ Future Bricks 🧱

- Sign up with Google OAuth
- Add CSRF protection if using cookies for JWT
- Implement full audit logs for user actions
- Add roles/permissions/notifications tabs in user admin
- Game entity: add icon field, tags, series, genre, dev/publisher
- Normalize game_media table (icon + cover)
- Frontend: update inputs, tables, pagination, bulk selectors
- New reusable phone number & date picker components
- API versioning for smooth upgrades
- Add OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing

---

## 🔒 Security Bricks 🧱

- DDOS/Abuse: request size limits, strict CORS, Helmet
- Auth brute force: stricter login rate limit, in-memory lock, optional CAPTCHA
- Cloudflare or WAF for edge protection
- Monitor unusual failed logins, store security logs
- Enforce HTTPS via proxy, manage certs with Let’s Encrypt
- CSP headers via Helmet/NGINX
- Secure cookies if JWT is cookie-based

---

## ✨ Frontend Polish Bricks 🧱

- Layout: redesign main actions dropdown (user_actions)
- Add modern table UI with flexible selectors & bulk events
- Make rows per page selector more intuitive
- Refine pagination component
- Color picker, date picker, phone input improvements
- Global component refresh for consistency

---

## ✅ How We Use This

- Add new ideas here when they come up.
- Move bricks to “Done” when finished.
- Keep reviewing and reshuffling priority — brick by brick!
